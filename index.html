        <p>Bailey is dedicated to whoever is paying them.</p>

                <a href="#"><h2>HTML</h2></a>
                <p>The knowledge of html is pretty much a requirement for any job.</p>
                <p>Bailey has a clear understanding of how to use html.</p>
                <p>Need convincing? They made this portfolio.</p>
                <p>Then why use the third person? You'll never know. They don't even know.</p>
                <p>Is this portfolio too sarcastic for actual use? Probably.</p>
                <p>They know how to use html. That's pretty much all you need to know from this section.</p>

                <p>Bailey clearly has a taste level that is "unique" and with your help, that style can invade the professional world!</p>
                <p>With their knowledge of CSS, you too can make your professional website look like the 90's and  2000's are having a war with the 2010's and 2020's!</p>
                <p>What's wrong? Do you not want that? They can make your website look like other things too.</p>
                <p>This is just what they go to when given no direction on what the site should look like.</p>
                <p>Their knowledge of CSS is all that matters here.</p>

                <h3>Why Should You Hire Them?</h3>
                <h5>Professionalism</h5>
                <p>Because obviously the the best choice for your needs is a person you found on the internet whose professional webpage looks like it was made by a middle schooler trying to be edgy.</p>
                <h5>Anonymity</h5>
                <p>As if all that wasn't enough, you can use their services anonymously. They won't tell anyone that you hired them if you don't want them to. Please ask nicely, though. Have you ever heard of someone hiring them? Didn't think so.</p>
                <h5>Representation</h5>
                <p>Still not convinced? Bailey offers your company everything that was previously listed, but WAIT! THERE'S MORE! If you've been accused of discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community, Bailey can be the token queer person at your company. If needed, they will also vouch for you and say that they've never faced any type of discrimination or harrassment while working for you.</p>
